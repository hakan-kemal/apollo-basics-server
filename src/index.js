// To build our graph API, we need to import the ApolloServer class from apollo-server
const { ApolloServer } = require('apollo-server');
// We also need to import our schema from src/schema.js.
const typeDefs = require('./schema');
// Second, we import our createStore function to set up our database, as well as our data sources:
const { createStore } = require('./utils');
// Third, import the LaunchAPI and UserAPI datasource classes/functions
const LaunchAPI = require('./datasources/launch');
const UserAPI = require('./datasources/user');
// Then, we create our database by calling createStore
const store = createStore();
// Next, let's create a new instance of ApolloServer and pass our schema to the typeDefs property on the configuration object.
const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  // Finally, we add the dataSources function to our ApolloServer to connect LaunchAPI and UserAPI to our graph.
  dataSources: () => ({
    launchAPI: new LaunchAPI(),
    userAPI: new UserAPI({ store })
  })
  // We also pass in our database we created to the UserAPI data source.
});
// If you use this.context in your datasource, it's critical to create a new instance in the dataSources function
// and to not share a single instance. Otherwise, initialize may be called during the execution of asynchronous code
// for a specific user, and replace the this.context by the context of another user.

// Now that we have scoped out our app's schema, let's run the server by calling server.listen()
server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ğŸš€ Server ready at ${url}`);
});
